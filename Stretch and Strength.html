    <h2>STRETCH AND STRENGTH</h2>
  </head>
    <h3>Stretch:</h3>
  <p>
      My stretch is time-management. I think that over the course of this year I have been improving, because in a map project in Social Studies I was finished with the project prior to the night before the due date. To manage my time better, I split up the work for the project a few days after receiving the assignment, then started on that work a few days later. In addition, anything we learn in class in Spanish, I study it after school so that when we have a test I already know the curriculumn. I think that I can make my stretch a strength by the end of the year if I continue on this path.

    <h3> Strength:</h3>
<p>
     My strength is organization. With the map project I leveraged my strength to complete and be successful when I drew the map and made annotations that got one hundred percent. In Literature during the time we are reading a chapter of a book out loud, we are graded on annotations, notes, and connections we make in our book. These notes help me answer comprehension questions we get for each chapter, better and with more information and analysis. In math, we take notes about the lesson we are learning on that specific day. Then when we are done learning and doing homework for that chapter, we have a practice test to help study  for the upcoming math test. Those notes help to finish the practice test accurately, and to bve ready for the test.
