      <h2>MID-YEAR REFLECTION </h2>
  </head>
   <h3> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted(within your group and/or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?
    </h3>
    <p> I have a strong core friend group that includes most of my class, though I am still friendly with the other class. Our class is able to lead the lower school with ease and accepts the youger kids as friends. To improve the social atmosphere, for one day we sat with the other grades at lunch. In hopes to make the other kids more accepted at this new campus and middle school atmosphere.</p>
    <h3> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social or from extracurricular activities). How have grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideaon how to assume these roles in the future?</h3>
