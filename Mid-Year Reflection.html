      <h2>MID-YEAR REFLECTION </h2>
  </head>
   <h3> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted(within your group and/or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?
    </h3>
    <p> I have a strong core friend group that includes most of my class, though I am still friendly with the other class. Our class is able to lead the lower school with ease and accepts the youger kids as friends. To improve the social atmosphere, for one day we sat with the other grades at lunch. In hopes to make the other kids more accepted at this new campus and middle school atmosphere.</p>
    <h3> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social or from extracurricular activities). How have grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</h3>
    <p> Every thursday of the month seventh and eighth graders go to Casa de Amistad to help the children with math through fun activities we make. I am happy to say that I have made it to all the thursdays. Casa is a way to learn how to be responsible around little kids and how to be a role model. And in soccer, a few years I have been team captain, that helped me be a role model among kids my ownn age.</p>
    <h3>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</h3>
    <p>I am consistent with completing work on time, but in past years I have been slow, because I procrastinate a lot. I woujld have a lot less stress if I didnt procrastinate, and that is why I have made it my stretch and I have a goal to go past that. I also have soccer practice three times a week after school, so I only get to homework by seven.</p>
