      <h2>ANUSHA'S DIGITAL PORTFOLIO</h2>
    <h3>My Smart Goal: </h3>
    <p>My name is Anusha, I am in eighth grade at the Rhoades School. I have been at this school for almost six years. My goal for the last year of middle school is to work on my analysis. This will help me in highschool since we have to do annotations and write more essays. This goal is attainable because when we are assigned annotations for Social Studies I will distribute the work and study vocabulary and sentence structure. I will keep track of my progress by the scores I get on the annotations. Three would a good summary, but little analysis. And four would be little summary and deep analysis.</p>
